## üß† Part 1: Commercial Recommender System ‚Äì Netflix

### What Technique Does Netflix Use?

Netflix uses a **hybrid recommender system** that combines:

- **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**: Learns from user behavior and preferences. If users A and B both liked similar shows, CF assumes they will enjoy other similar content.

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses metadata like genre, director, cast, and keywords to recommend items with similar attributes to content you've watched.

- **Contextual Bandits and Deep Learning**: Netflix also adapts to time of day, device, or recent watch history using advanced machine learning models.

### Diagram: How Netflix‚Äôs Hybrid Recommender System Works

```{r netflix-diagram, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz("
digraph netflix_recommender {
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
  
  node [shape = rectangle, style=filled, fillcolor=lightblue]
  
  U [label = 'User Preferences']
  CF [label = 'Collaborative Filtering']
  CB [label = 'Content-Based Filtering']
  ML [label = 'ML/Contextual Bandits']
  R [label = 'Recommendations']
  
  U -> CF
  U -> CB
  CF -> ML
  CB -> ML
  ML -> R
}
")
```


### Does the System Work Well?

**Yes, but not perfectly.** Netflix is generally successful at recommending relevant content. However, there are some issues:

- **Pros**:

  - Accurate suggestions based on past behavior.
  
  - Personalized landing pages and rows.
  
  - Variety of content is well-organized into categories.

- **Cons**:

  - Tends to reinforce viewing habits (filter bubbles).
  
  - Hard to discover new content unless it's trending or featured.
  
  - Cold-start problem for brand-new users.

## üé¨ Part 2: Non-Personalized Recommender ‚Äì Rotten Tomatoes

### How Does Rotten Tomatoes Work?

Rotten Tomatoes is a **non-personalized recommender** system based on aggregated critic and audience reviews.

- **Tomatometer Score**: Percentage of approved critics who gave the film a positive review.

- **Audience Score**: Based on verified audience ratings.

- **Fresh/Rotten Labels**: Simple binary system to classify reviews.

### Do I Prefer This System?

I like Rotten Tomatoes for getting a **general sense** of how well a movie is received. However, because it's not personalized:

- I use it for **initial screening**, not final decision-making.

- I find the **audience score** more aligned with my taste than critic reviews.

## üß® Part 3: Attacks on Recommender Systems

### Summary of the IMDb Incident

In the article *"Wisdom of the crowd? IMDb users gang up on Christian Bale‚Äôs new movie before it even opens"* (Washington Post, 2017):

- A **coordinated effort** by online users bombarded the IMDb page of *The Promise* with negative reviews **before its release**.

- This resulted in an **artificially low rating**, influencing public perception unfairly.

### Similar Example: Review Bombing

A similar event occurred with the game *The Last of Us Part II*, where:

- Users unhappy with certain plot points or political themes **organized campaigns** to leave negative reviews.

- Ratings plummeted on platforms like Metacritic within hours of release.

### How to Prevent These Attacks

To prevent rating manipulation:

- **Verification System**: Only allow users who‚Äôve purchased or streamed the content to leave a review.

- **Time-Based Filters**: Prevent ratings until a product is officially released.

- **Reputation Scores**: Weight reviews based on user history and trustworthiness.

- **Anomaly Detection**: Use ML models to flag sudden influxes of extreme reviews.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Compare written reviews to star ratings for consistency.

## üí¨ Final Thoughts

Recommender systems are powerful but vulnerable to manipulation. As seen in both IMDb and Metacritic, **platform integrity depends on moderation and smart algorithm design**. Personalization can improve user experience, but ethical and secure design is just as important.
