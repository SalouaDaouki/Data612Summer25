## ðŸ§  Part 1: Commercial Recommender System â€“ Netflix

### What Technique Does Netflix Use?

Netflix uses a **hybrid recommender system** that combines:

- **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**: Learns from user behavior and preferences. If users A and B both liked similar shows, CF assumes they will enjoy other similar content.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses metadata like genre, director, cast, and keywords to recommend items with similar attributes to content you've watched.
- **Contextual Bandits and Deep Learning**: Netflix also adapts to time of day, device, or recent watch history using advanced machine learning models.

### Does the System Work Well?

**Yes, but not perfectly.** Netflix is generally successful at recommending relevant content. However, there are some issues:

- **Pros**:
  - Accurate suggestions based on past behavior.
  - Personalized landing pages and rows.
  - Variety of content is well-organized into categories.

- **Cons**:
  - Tends to reinforce viewing habits (filter bubbles).
  - Hard to discover new content unless it's trending or featured.
  - Cold-start problem for brand-new users.

## ðŸŽ¬ Part 2: Non-Personalized Recommender â€“ Rotten Tomatoes

### How Does Rotten Tomatoes Work?

Rotten Tomatoes is a **non-personalized recommender** system based on aggregated critic and audience reviews.

- **Tomatometer Score**: Percentage of approved critics who gave the film a positive review.
- **Audience Score**: Based on verified audience ratings.
- **Fresh/Rotten Labels**: Simple binary system to classify reviews.

### Do I Prefer This System?

I like Rotten Tomatoes for getting a **general sense** of how well a movie is received. However, because it's not personalized:

- I use it for **initial screening**, not final decision-making.
- I find the **audience score** more aligned with my taste than critic reviews.

## ðŸ§¨ Part 3: Attacks on Recommender Systems

### Summary of the IMDb Incident

In the article *"Wisdom of the crowd? IMDb users gang up on Christian Baleâ€™s new movie before it even opens"* (Washington Post, 2017):

- A **coordinated effort** by online users bombarded the IMDb page of *The Promise* with negative reviews **before its release**.
- This resulted in an **artificially low rating**, influencing public perception unfairly.

### Similar Example: Review Bombing

A similar event occurred with the game *The Last of Us Part II*, where:

- Users unhappy with certain plot points or political themes **organized campaigns** to leave negative reviews.
- Ratings plummeted on platforms like Metacritic within hours of release.

### How to Prevent These Attacks

To prevent rating manipulation:

- **Verification System**: Only allow users whoâ€™ve purchased or streamed the content to leave a review.
- **Time-Based Filters**: Prevent ratings until a product is officially released.
- **Reputation Scores**: Weight reviews based on user history and trustworthiness.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Use ML models to flag sudden influxes of extreme reviews.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Compare written reviews to star ratings for consistency.

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts

Recommender systems are powerful but vulnerable to manipulation. As seen in both IMDb and Metacritic, **platform integrity depends on moderation and smart algorithm design**. Personalization can improve user experience, but ethical and secure design is just as important.
